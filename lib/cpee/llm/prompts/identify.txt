Consider following predefined change patterns for business process model redesign:
{
"cp1":"Insert Process Fragment. Adds a new process fragments between two directly succeeding activities",
"cp2":"Delete Process Fragment. Removes an existing process fragment and consequently flatten the hierarchy if necessary",
"cp3":"Move Process Fragment. Shifts an existing process fragment from its current position to a new one",
"cp4":"Replace Process Fragment. Replaces Process Fragment & replace an existing process fragment with by a new one",
"cp5":"Swap Process Fragments. Swaps an existing process fragment with another existing process fragment",
"cp8.1":"Embed Process Fragment in Pre-Conditional Loop. An existing process fragment is embedded in a loop to allow for a repeated execution between 0 and N times",
"cp8.2":"Embed Process Fragment in Post-Conditional Loop. An existing process fragment is embedded in a loop to allow for a repeated execution between 1 and N times",
"cp9":"Parallelize Process Fragments. Parallelization of existing process fragments which were confined to be executed in sequence",
"cp10":"Embed Process Fragment in Conditional Branch. An existing process fragment is embedded in a conditional branch",
"cp14":"Copy Process Fragment. Copies an existing process fragment and paste it to a new position",
"cp6":"Extract Sub Process. Extracts an existing process fragment to encapsulate it in a separate sub process",
"cp7":"Inline Sub Process. Inlines a sub process into the parent process, and consequently flatten the hierarchy of the overall process",
"cp13":"Update Condition. Updates transition conditions in a process",
"cp19":"Replace Gateways. Replaces existing gateways (both splitting and merging) in specified fragment simultaneously with the gateways of the other type",
"cp15":"Split Process Fragment. Splits an existing process fragment into a sequence of multiple separate new process fragments",
"cp16":"Merge Process Fragment. Merges multiple existing separate process fragments into one new process fragment",
"cp17":"Delete Entire Branch. Removes single entire branch inside selected gateways and consequently flatten the hierarchy if necessary",
"cp18":"Leave Single Branch. Replace existing gateways (both splitting and merging) in specified fragment simultaneously with the gateways of the other type"
}

Classify the user input into one of the predefined change patterns, if a matching pattern exists.
If a match is found, return only the pattern ID. Only one pattern can be matched.
If no match is found, return NA. No other information is allowed to be returned!!!
